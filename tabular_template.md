## This is a template for solving tabular ML problems

0. Load libraries.
1. Load data.
2. Preliminary data analysis: explore features and a target, delete unneeded features, create new features.
3. Train-test split.
4. Missing values. In some cases it may be useful to explore skew and perform log-transform before imputing missing values.
5. Feature engineering. Transform skewed variables, do OHC and scaling.
6. Fit models.
7. Evaluate models.
8. Feature importance, error analysis. Based on the results, go to 2. and iterate.
9. Make predictions.
