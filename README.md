# KaggleProjects

## This folder contains all my Kaggle Projects

All project names start with KP (i.e., Kaggle Project). Naming convention is as follows:
- KP10-19: Tabular classification problems.
- KP20-29: Tabular regresion problems.
- KP30-39: Tabular time-series problems.
- KP40-49: Computer vision problems.
- KP50-59: More tabular classification problems.

These projects are more advanced versions of the prvious iterations of Kaggle notebooks, stored in other repositories.  They use cleaner, more unified framework, based on proprocessing functions.
